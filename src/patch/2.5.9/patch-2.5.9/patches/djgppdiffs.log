|	* quotearg.h: Add quoting styles for DOS and NT shells.  Add
|	"default" pseudo-style.
|	[DEFAULT_QUOTING_STYLE]: Now defaults to `default_quoting_style'.
|
|	* quotearg.c [DEFAULT_OS_QUOTING_STYLE]: If not defined, make it
|	default to `shell_quoting_style'.
|	[DEFAULT_OS_QUOTING_STYLE_DCL]: Use if defined.
|	(quoting_style_args): Add quoting styles for DOS and NT shells.
|	Add "default" pseudo-style.
|	(set_quoting_style): If S is `default_quoting_style', use whatever
|	DEFAULT_OS_QUOTING_STYLE yields.
|	(quotearg_buffer): Support quoting suitable for DOS and NT shells.
|
|	* quotesys.c (quote_system_arg) [quote_system_arg_func]: If this
|	hook for quoting `system' arguments on non-Posix platforms is
|	defined, call it instead of the usual code.
|
|	* pc/pc_quote.c: New file.
|	(dos_nt_quoting): New function to determine the default quoting
|	style suitable for the user shell on MS-DOS/MS-Windows systems.
|
|	* pc/djgpp/config_h.sed: Define DEFAULT_OS_QUOTING_STYLE to be a
|	call to `dos_nt_quoting', and define DEFAULT_OS_QUOTING_STYLE_DCL
|	to declare its prototype.
|	Define filename_char_eq to compare characters regardless of the
|	letter-case.
|
|	* addext.c (addext): Support numbered backups under DOS 8+3 file
|	name limits.
|
|	* backupfile.c (max_backup_version): Under HAVE_DOS_FILE_NAMES,
|	don't give up on file names unless they are shorter than the
|	original file's name.
|	(version_number): Use filename_char_eq to compare file names on
|	case-insensitive filesystems.  Support numbered backups under 8+3
|	file name limits.
