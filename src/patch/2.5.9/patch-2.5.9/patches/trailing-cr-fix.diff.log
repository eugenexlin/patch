Hmm...  Looks like a unified diff to me...

|	Thanks for the bug report.  Unfortunately that fix doesn't handle the
|	case correctly where a Unix file contains a trailing CR in a header
|	line that is output by "diff -p" (trailing CR and all).
|
|	How about the following patch instead?
|
|--- patch-2.5.9.orig/pch.c	2003/05/20 14:03:17	1.44
|+++ patch-2.5.9/pch.c	2003/07/02 22:19:21	1.45
--------------------------
Patching file pch.c using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 366.
Hunk #3 succeeded at 415.
Not setting time of file pch.c (time mismatch)
Hmm...  Ignoring the trailing garbage.
done
